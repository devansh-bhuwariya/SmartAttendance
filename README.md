# Smart Attendance
This project focuses on developing an automated attendance management system using advanced computer vision technology. The goal is to create a robust, efficient, and accurate system that minimizes human intervention and maximizes precision in attendance tracking.

## Data
The dataset used for this project consists of images of 60 students, with each student having 10 images captured from various angles, ensuring a diverse set of facial orientations and expressions. The data was collected in controlled environments to ensure consistent lighting and background settings.

## Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project are:
* Automated Attendance Generation: Develop a system that automatically generates class attendance records, eliminating the need for manual tracking and reducing administrative burden.
* Smartboard Camera Integration: Utilize a smartboard camera for data collection, providing a comprehensive view of the classroom.
* Facial Detection in Challenging Conditions: Implement robust facial detection algorithms to accurately identify student faces even in low illumination and varied image sizes.
* Facial Recognition Under Varied Distances: Develop facial recognition capabilities that adapt to varying distances between students and the camera.
* Adaptive Illumination Control: Implement adaptive illumination control to enhance visibility of facial features in low-light conditions.

## Tools Used
The following tools were used in this project:
* Python: programming language used for data analysis and visualization
